            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>FitnessCalculatorAir is a web-based application for quick and easy calculation of key health and fitness
                metrics. Users can determine their body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage, ideal weight and other
                values - directly in the browser and without installation. In the planned next expansion stage, the
                project can be expanded to include storage functions, visualizations and integration into modern
                frameworks such as Angular.</p>
